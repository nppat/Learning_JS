# Discussion Board #
This assignment had the user being able to login or register to an account.
The user is directed to a dashboard where all topics from all users are available to choose from.
User is able to create a new topic, click on an available topic, or click on a user to view their profile
Topics are loaded with replies in the form of posts and comments, with posts being able to be up/down voted
User profile shows running total of topics, posts, and comments created by the user

### Difficulties ###
Once again, associations between models is my weakness.
Also had difficulty with comments not being able to be created, but this was due to a misplacement of the comment 
	form on the topic partial, not being included with the post to be able to pull the post id.


#### Once again Mr. Tommy Oh is a great resource to see where you've done wrong! ####
